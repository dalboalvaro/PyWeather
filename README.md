Observable Trends
- There is a direct relation between latitude and maximum temperatures. 
  The highest maximum temperatures are concentrated in latitudes close to zero, and decrease as latitudes get more distant to the Equator Line
- There is no relation between latitudes and humidity, cloudiness or wind speed, distributed equally in all latitudes.
